    "- Role-Based Agent Design: Customize agents with specific roles, goals, and tools.\n",
    "- Autonomous Inter-Agent Delegation: Agents can autonomously delegate tasks and inquire amongst themselves, enhancing problem-solving efficiency.\n",
    "- Flexible Task Management: Define tasks with customizable tools and assign them to agents dynamically.\n",
    "- Processes Driven: Currently only supports sequential task execution and hierarchical processes, but more complex processes like consensual and autonomous are being worked on.\n",

      "To enable code execution for an agent, you need to set the allow_code_execution parameter to True when creating the agent. It is recommended to use more capable models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4 for code execution tasks as they have a better understanding of programming concepts. The code execution feature includes error handling, allowing agents to receive error messages if the executed code raises an exception. Additionally, installing the crewai_tools package is necessary to use the code execution feature.\n",

      "The code execution process involves the agent analyzing the task, formulating Python code to solve the problem, sending the code to the internal CodeInterpreterTool for execution, and interpreting the result for further problem-solving. An example of creating an agent with code execution capabilities and using it in a data analysis task is provided for reference.\n",
